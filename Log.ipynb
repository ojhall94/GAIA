    "### Notes:\n",
    "I'm continuing to use the Hall BC's for now--- the Luca BC's are tightly correlated, but they do appear to have a small offset to fainter values, which will provide a good comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To do list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recreate the Hawkins HBMM\n",
    "- Properly treat the dupliates from the Kepler-Gaia-fun sample.\n",
    "- Properly look at the distance dependence of high uncertainty Gaia stars (Likely due to prior)\n",
    "- Compare classifications between Andrae+18 and Yu+18\n",
    "- Use the correct corrections for the RC Radii and thus luminosity (Yu+18)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completed:\n",
    "- Read the Yu+18 catalogue for caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "--- The data has a selection effect in Kepler\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate weird outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "--- These data are due to a selection effect in Kepler, but belong to the sample nonetheless\n",
