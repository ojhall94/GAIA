If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.


Gradient evaluation took 0.011445 seconds
1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 114.45 seconds.
Adjust your expectations accordingly!
